      <h3>Cultural: Chef's Kitchen 4/11/2015</h3>
      <p> I really like DBC emphasis on urging students to take control of their own education. Shereef's analogy of students going into the kitchen with apron on and being hungry to create something, is my mentality of why I signed up for DBC in the first place. I am very excited and eager to learn about something I don't really have any experience with before. And I know in order for me to do that in a fast learning environment, I have to collaborate and rely on my cohort as well as my teachers. I'm very confident that when I get out of DBC, not only did I learn coding, but also built relationships with people and established the mindset of creating things. I think this aspect of taking control of our education is something not emphasize in schools, as we're always given a syllabus and a cirriculum to follow. I'm very excited to participate in this learning environment and I can't wait to see everyone onsite!</p>

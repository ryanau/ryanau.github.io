      <h3>Cultural | Thinking Style 4/26/2015</h3>
      <h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
      <p>After completing the test, I was identified as a concrete random thinker. I think this reflects pretty accurately of my thinking style throughout the 3 weeks. I learn the best by using a trial-and-error approaches but sometimes it frustrates me when I do not figure out the correct code after many times of trial and error. The partner session does help a lot at some cases. It's always very helpful to me when I talk and express my thought process out loud with my partner, as both of us can build on our ideas and improve upon them. It's also helpful learning from other people and their thought procces.</P>
      <p>Even though having a growth mindset is something hard to achieve, it is definitely something I have been trying to work on over these past couple weeks. DevBootcamp gives students like me opportunities to deal with the criteria it takes to have a growth mindset. Some of the critera include embracing challenges and learn from criticism. I think it is very important to learn from constructive feedback as that is the most effective way we can learn from our mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, but it is those who can avoid them succeed in the future.</p>

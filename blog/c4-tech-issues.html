      <h2>Secruity Issue</h2>
      <p>Ever since Edward Snowden revealed the national and international surveillance operations conducted by NSA, people are becoming more aware about cyber security and the future of technology. Governments are using combating terrorism as a reason for them to conduct these secretive operations that often infringe a lot of their own citizens' privacies without them knowing. Part of the reasons behind this phenomenon is the rapid advance in technology. Without the appropriate technology, the NSA would not be able to process this amount of data. A lot of start ups in the Silicon Valley now exclusively develop technology for the US military and surveillance agencies since they are way more lucrative than selling them to US corporations.</p>
      <h2>Solution?</h2>
      <p>Ultimately, the power is in the hands of its citizens. If the US citizens all unite and stand together to oppose the act of this form by the government, by supporting senators that oppose the passing of these bills that fuel the surveillance operations, the government will eventually stop. The question is, will we do that?</p>

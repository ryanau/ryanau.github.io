      <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
      <h4>Pairing is Caring</h4>
      <p>One of the things DevBootcamp encouraged us to do is to pair with people to solve the challenges together. At first, I was unsure about the effectiveness of pairing with people because I imagined it to be time consuming and inefficient. After a couple pairing sessions, however, I quickly realized the beauty of working with others, especially solving a problem together.</p>
      <p>One thing that stood out right away is you got 2 brains instead of one when you work with others. It's easier to solve a problem when you bounce it off your partner and think about it together. A lot of times "Ah Ha" moments just happen because of the discussion you have with your partner in solving a problem</p>
      <p>Another thing that I appreciate during a pairing session is the difference in skill and experience level. Sometimes you might be more experienced, at other times it might be vice versa. If you're less experienced, you can obviously learn so much more when you have a mentor that walks you through the process and answers your questions immediately. If you're more experienced, you can equally benefit yourself by teaching other people and articulating your thoughts or knowledge to your partner. Both sides are equally important and beneficial.</p>
      <p>On top of that, you get to meet new friends! That's obviously something you can't do without a partner during a pairing session, something that even Googling can't help...</p>
      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>After each pairing session, we would write a feedback for our partner. This is a good time to reflect on the pairing session we had and to inform your partner your thoughts regarding the session. It's always good and helpful to provide constructive criticism for your partner so he/she can improve upon it next time. But don't forget! Say something nice to your partner, I'm sure he/she will appreciate it and have a smile when he/she reads it.</p>
      <p>Not only are you required to write a feedback, you can also read feedback that others have written about you. While you're reading through these feedback, it is a good time for you to reflect and see if others provided you with constructive criticism. Pairing with others is a learning process that it takes time to perfect at it. And collaborating is a form of art, as it takes practice. Sometimes, you might not necessarily agree with what your partner wrote, that's okay, because after all, everyone is dfferent! But try to incorporate what others had to write about you and really reflect upon it. This will only do you good in the long run:)</p>

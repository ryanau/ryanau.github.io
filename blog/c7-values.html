      <h3>Cultural | Affirmation and Stereotype Threat 5/22/2015</h3>
      <h4>Exploring your values</h4>
      <p>When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, proudest, or the most satisfied, these values come into mind.</p>
      <xmp>
      Adventure
      Challenge
      Close relationships
      Creditbility
      Excitement
      Friendships
      Health
      Helping others
      Influence
      Insight
      Integrity
      Leadership
      Mentorship
      Privacy
      Responsbility
      </xmp>
      <p>In general, I try to live up to these values:</p>
      <xmp>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</xmp>
      <xmp>
      Adventure: 5
      Challenge: 4
      Close relationships: 4
      Creditbility: 5
      Excitement: 4
      Friendships: 4
      Health: 4
      Helping others: 3
      Influence: 4
      Insight: 3
      Integrity: 5
      Leadership: 4
      Mentorship: 4
      Privacy: 5
      Responsbility: 4
      Respect: 5
      </xmp>
      <p>For me, I think respect is something crucial in my life. Having respect to someone shows that you acknowledge the other person's presence and care about his/her dignity. Simple actions such as making eye contact, saying hi to them when you walk pass them will make them feel like they're valued by you. This is very important in maintaining positive relationships with people even though you might not necessarily be close to them. This creates a good impression.</p>
      <h4>Advice</h4>
      <p>The last time someone asked me for advice was probably on the topic of stress. People seem to see me as a person that manages stress well. Some of the things I do to destress is to exercise and smile! Have a beer or two helps too, but I would recommend drinking it while hanging out with your friends. This makes you realize and treasure the fact that there are people you can lean on and talk to.</p>
      <h4>Values and Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <p>I think that respecting people will provide you long-term benefit in terms of your interperson relationships.</p>

      <h4>Identifying a Conflict from Personal Experiences</h4>
      <p>Usually I try to avoid conflicts at all cost because I think they are a waste of time that hurts relationships between people. If it does emerge, however, I actively try to solve them by first talking it out loud with the other person. From my past experiences, a lot of time conflicts emerge because of misunderstandings.</p>
      <p>A small conflict that I experienced recently was with my girlfriend, when we were deciding where to go for our spring break trip. The source of conflict came when I wanted to finalize our trip destination so we could take advantage of cheaper air fares and hotel bookings. Since we both had different preferences regarding the weather and excursion, we couldn't come to a conclusion after couple hours of discussions, even though I had already spent hours researching and planning the trip. I think what sparked the conflict was the fact that I tend to not ask for people's input when planning things because that is more efficient and effective.</p>
      <p>If I could go back, I would've asked for more girlfriend's input earlier so the conflict could've been avoided.</p>

      <h3>Phase 1 Week 1 | 6/13/2015 </h3>
      <h2>The week that flew by!</h2>
      <p>Week 1 of phase 1 at DBC was definitely a hell of a ride. For the most days during the week, I was getting into DBC at 7am and not leaving until 10pm. The surprising thing was that I never felt sleepy during the day, probably because I was constantly powering throughing all the problems all day, every moment. And here are some of the highlights or AH HA moment! of the week.</p>
      <p>From the Roman Numerals challenge: Iteration is your friend! My partner and I approached this problem at first with many different case statements, and checking the number index by index. But the smarter solution is definitely using each loop and modifying the number pass through the argument using %.</p>
      <p>From Pig Latin challenge: Ruby built in methods are really useful! Especailly .rotate .map and using regex.</p>
      <p>From Enumerable Methods: So I actually skipped this challenge on the day, which caused us a lot of time to figure out the iteration when building the Sudoku solver... BUT! .each_with_index is the best! You can use that as a built-in counter when iterating through the loop!</p>
      <p>From RegEx SSN challenge: gsub and regex is soooo useful. Especially when you can extract groups and use them later. e.g. string.gsub(/(\d{3})\D*(\d{2})\D*(\d{4})/, '\1-\2-\3')</p>
      <p>From Fibonacci challenge: Need a base case for recursive!</p>
      <p>From Binary Search challenge: WATCH OUT FOR MATH ORDER OF OPERATIONS
      <p>From 5 Remainder challenge (breakout session): to make an internal counter in the recursive method, use return 1 + function, so you need how many times the recursion runs.</p>
      <p>From Ruby Racer challenge: Think in terms of objects! Like creating multiple classes so you can access the behavior and alter them much easier! Use until loop outside of the class itself to call the function repeatedly. It should break with some kind of finish? method.</p>
      <p>From Basketball Team Roster challenge: Ruby method .zip and .product is especially useful for transforming information from array of string to fit data structure. Especially when there's a header that you need to use it as a key of the hash, and pair with different values.</p>
      <p>From Boggle Board: Didn't create the checker method yet... But! Building a method to index the surroundings of an element is important. As that can be applied for the Sudoku challenge problem. Then use recursion.</p>

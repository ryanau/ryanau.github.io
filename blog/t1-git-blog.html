      <h3>Technical: Version Control Concept 4/11/2015</h3>
      <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
      <p>
      Version control allows coder to keep track of different changes made to the code. The benefits is to allow users to easily go back to previous version of code if there's a mistake being made. Think of version control as a check point when playing a video game! 
      </p>
      <h4>How does "git" help you keep track of changes?</h4>
      <p>
      GitHub is a website that provides the service for users to use "git" more easily, in which "git" itself is the version control application. Every time you make a change to your local file, e.g. writing couple more lines of code when you're designing your software, you can "save" your work to GitHub (since they provide the server) via making a "commit" to store changes using git. GitHub will then store all the different versions of the files on line, and you can simply go back to the previous version by choosing them online. Also, to help you know what you've changed in the file before you commit, you have to input a message.
      </p>
      <p>This will act like a reminder to people (or to yourself) what have changed in the version of the file. This will comes in very handy especially when you're collaborating with different people on a project. GitHub acts as a central host for the main file, keeping track of everyone's changes on the file. Your team member can now download others' changes to the file by simply using GitHub 
      </p>
      <h4>Why use Github to store your code?</h4>
      <p>
      Although you can simply create different files for changes you make on your personal computer, using GitHub to store your code provides more way more benefits. First off, by using GitHub, you can access and download the files you're working on anywhere without access to your personal computer because they are all stored up in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, GitHub is designed to make the version control simpler and more convenient. Obviously, it might take people a couple tries to understand how to use it... Once you're confident with it, GitHub provides benefits such as making the version control easier, as it's all automatically organized by dates with the commit message you chose. That way, it's very simple to organize and access your files. </p>
        <p>Lastly, since GitHub is a website, it is meant to be an online collaboration platform. Different team members can access the files store online and do their own part without disturbing the other people. Once they're done with their codes, they can commit their changes and send them to the cloud. Other team members can conveniently download and merge their team members' changes on their own versions.

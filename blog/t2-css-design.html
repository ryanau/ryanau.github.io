      <h2>What is CSS positioning?</h2>
      <p>In CSS, positioning might be something tricky for beginners. But if you spend a little time practicing and experimenting it, you'll quickly figure out how positiong works and how to perfect it. Let's take a look!</P>
      <p>There are 3 main types of positioning: fixed, absolute and relative. These positiongs are can be applied to different elements, and sometimes, a certain positiong option for an element will affect other elements on the page with a different positiong option.
      <h4>Fixed Positioning</h4>
      <p>An element with a fixed positiong is positioned relative to the web browser window, and will not move even if the window is scrolled. A practical example of this is when you want to have a sticky header that stays on top even as you scroll. Or a sticky footer that stays at the bottom of the page. To do that, you combine position: fixed with either top: 20px or bottom: 20px depending on if it is a header or a footer, and how much space would like in between the header or footer with the edge of the browser window.
      <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
      <p>An element with a relative positioning is positioned relative to its normal position. This means that you can move the element around using top, bottom, left and right to move it where you want it relative to its normal/starting position.
      <h4>Absolute Positioning</h4>
      <p>An element with an absolute positioning is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. Absolute positioning allows you to put the element exaclty where you want to go. But what's more powerful, is where you want to put this element with aboslute positing relative to another element. If we put a div with absolute positioning within a div with an relative positioning, that the div with absolute positioning will be placed in any position you specified relative to the element with relative positioning.</p>

      <h3>Technical | Object Oriented Vs. Functional Programming 5/20/2015</h3>
      <h2>What are Objected Oriented and Functional Programming?</h2>
      <p>In the world of programming, there are two main kinds of programming paradigms approaches: Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming. Both types of approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses, and are suitable for us in different scenarios.</P>
      <h4>Objected Oriented Programming (OOP)</h4>
      <p>This is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. In this approach, programmers really care about the objects they want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. The object oriented aspect can be described in an analogy where humans describe things like chairs, tables in their lives. And each of this objects have their own functions. Once an object has been identified, the programmers will need to know how they relate to each other. Then, the object is generalized as a class of objects, which defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it.</p>
      <p>Each distinct logic sequence is known as "method" and objects communicate with well-defined interfaces called "messages."</p>
      <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
      <p>This is a programming language that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids mutable data and changing state. There are TWO core concepts that are central to functional programming.</p>
      <p>First, data in functional programs are immutable. This means that data doesn't get modified. Instead, to update data, a new set of data is simply created. Second, functional programs stateless, meaning that they should perform every task as if for the first time. The functions will operate only on data passed in as arguments and will never rely on outside values to perform their calculations.</p>
      <h4>So which language is better?</h4>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, each of these languages have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>OOP is good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.</p>
